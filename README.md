In the "Merry Christmas" project, the control of the lights is provided by an Arduino Uno board, while for playing the melodies, we opted for an Arduino Nano board. The sound is generated through a buzzer connected to the Arduino Nano board. To handle the pin limitations, the LEDs are connected to the Arduino Uno, while the remaining LEDs and the speaker are connected to a second Arduino Nano board.
